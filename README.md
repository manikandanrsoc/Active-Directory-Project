# Active-Directory-Project

## Objective

The objective of this project is to set up an Active Directory environment and simulate various administrative tasks and security scenarios. This hands-on project will provide insights into IT Administration, domain management, event logging with Splunk, and security testing using Kali Linux and Atomic Red Team.

### Skills Learned

- IT Administration
- Active Directory Configuration
- Event Logging and Monitoring
- Security Testing and Telemetry Analysis
- Splunk Administration and Querying
- Virtualization and Networking

### Tools Used

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10
- Kali Linux
- Splunk (using Ubuntu Server)
- VirtualBox
- Atomic Red Team


Steps
Step 1: Build a Logical Diagram

Create a logical diagram outlining the architecture of your Active Directory setup, including the Windows Server (domain controller), Windows 10 (target machine), Kali Linux (attacking machine), and Splunk server.

Step 2: Install Virtual Machines

Download and install the necessary virtual machines:

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10
- Kali Linux
- Ubuntu Server (for Splunk)

Use VirtualBox to set up and configure these VMs.

Step 3: Install and Configure Software

1. Install and configure the Windows Server and Windows 10 machines.
2. Install and configure Splunk on the Ubuntu Server. Set up Splunk to ingest events from your Windows Server and Windows 10 machine.
3. Learn to create queries, alerts, dashboards, and reports in Splunk. (Note: This project will not cover the creation of alerts, reports, and dashboards in detail).

Step 4: Configure Active Directory

1. Install and configure Active Directory on the Windows Server.
2. Promote the Windows Server to a domain controller.
3. Create new domain users for logging into the domain.
4. Join the Windows 10 target machine to the domain.

Step 5: Generate Telemetry with Kali Linux & Atomic Red Team

1. Use Kali Linux to perform a brute force attack targeting one of the domain users created in Step 4.
2. Observe and analyze the telemetry generated by this attack in Splunk.
3. Install and use Atomic Red Team to run additional tests and generate various types of telemetry for analysis.

Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive, hands-on experience in setting up and managing an Active Directory environment, integrating with Splunk for event logging and monitoring, and conducting security testing using Kali Linux and Atomic Red Team.
